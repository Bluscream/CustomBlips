# CustomBlips
Custom Blips RagePluginHook Plugin

This plugin allows anyone to quickly add new Blips to your game.

To accomplish this it reads all XML files from your `<GTAV>\plugins\customBlips` folder and creates the containing blips.

You can create and look at such a XML file by using the RPH console commands `AddBlip` and `SaveBlip`
